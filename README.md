# CAB420 (Machine Learning) Examples

This repository contains the code examples used for CAB420 (Machine Learning). Examples can be grouped into:

*  *core* examples, which are numbered examples for each topic, and which contain the main concepts covered in the unit. 
*  *additional* examples, which have been used to generate additional content for slides and are included for completeness, and are very much optional.
*  *bonus* examples, which extend the core content and are once again very much optional.
